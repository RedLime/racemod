# racemod
A 1.7 tournament mod that makes major sources of RNG consistent between different players playing on the same seed.

- Endermen, blaze, spider, sheep, cow, pig, and chicken rates are all standardized.
- Eye breaks are standardised
- Flint RNG is standardised
- Eyes of ender always point towards the portal room regardless of relogs
- All ravines are removed
- Mobs will not spawn in temples during the daytime
- All water and lava pools below y60 are removed (this is different from lava *lakes*, which still occur at y10).
- Surface lava pools are more common
- Desert Hills are replaced by normal desert to make terrain flatter
- Ghast spawns are disabled


This mod requires Legacy Fabric 0.12.12+.

Racemod is for tournament competitors. If you're a seedfinder, put both racemod and [Seedfinder's Mod](https://github.com/pixfumy/seedfinders-mod) into your mods folder. The latter of which lets you check and manipulate standardized RNG using commands.
